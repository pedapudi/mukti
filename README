Recent political events in middle-eastern and north-african countries have 
demonstrated that traditional communication media are useless when 
infrastructure is controlled by a rogue/oppressive regime. Similar situation 
can also arise due to large natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes, tsunami) that 
can wipe out complete communication infrastructure. While sending information 
outside a region is dependent on the availability of a handful of egress 
points, communication inside the region can be enabled using wireless mesh 
networks (WMN). By incorporating ideas from delay-tolerant networking (DTN) 
literature, eventual reachability can also be ensured. Our goal is to build 
an application for smart phones to enable dissemination of information in 
hostile/disrupted environments by incorporating WMN and DTN features. While 
our initial medium of data transfer will be WiFi, ideally our application 
should be able to opportunistically use 3G and Bluetooth as well.

Wireless Tether for Root Users
--------------------------

This software turns your android-based handset (tested with a T-Mobile G1) into something like
a wireless access point (that's incorrect in technical-view because the wireless interface will be 
set up in AdHoc-Mode). Clients can connect via wifi or bluetooth and get access to internet using 
the 3G-connection (GPRS/EDGE/UMTS/HSDPA) which is established by the handset.

Warning:
--------
This application needs root-permission.
